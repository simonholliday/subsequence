"""Constants for Subsequence.

This package contains three sets of constants:

- ``subsequence.constants.pulses`` - Pulse-based MIDI timing (internal engine use)
- ``subsequence.constants.durations`` - Beat-based durations for pattern lengths and steps
- ``subsequence.constants.velocity`` - MIDI velocity constants
- ``subsequence.constants.instruments`` - Instrument-specific note maps (GM, Vermona, etc.)
- ``subsequence.constants.midi_notes`` - Named MIDI note constants C0–G9, C4 = 60 (Middle C)

Pulse constants are re-exported here for backwards compatibility, so
``subsequence.constants.MIDI_QUARTER_NOTE`` continues to work.
"""

# Re-export pulse constants for backwards compatibility.
# These match the values in subsequence.constants.pulses.

MIDI_THIRTYSECOND_NOTE = 3
MIDI_SIXTEENTH_NOTE = 6
MIDI_EIGHTH_NOTE = 12
MIDI_QUARTER_NOTE = 24
MIDI_HALF_NOTE = 48
